This view works basicly like every other view in Lux. You can filter your shorteners per searchterm, category or per
timeframe. Diagrams are showing you "overall usage", "top shortener" and visits from "socialmedia".

A click on an existing shortener will show you individual information about the leads that used this shortener.
